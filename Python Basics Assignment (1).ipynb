    "1.\tExplain the key features of python that make it a popular choice for programming?\n",
    "\n",
    " Ans:- The following are some of the features in Python that are discussed below:\n",
    " \n",
    "1. Easy to Code\n",
    "Python is a very high-level programming language, learning the basic Python syntax is very easy, as compared to other popular languages like C, C++, and Java.\n",
    "2. Easy to Read\n",
    "Python code looks like simple English words. There is no use of semicolons or brackets, and the indentations define the code block. You can tell what the code is supposed to do simply by looking at it.\n",
    "3. Free and Open-Source\n",
    "it is completely free to use, even for commercial purposes. It doesn't cost anything to download Python or to include it in your application. It can also be freely modified and re-distributed. Python can be downloaded from the official Python website.\n",
    "4. Robust Standard Library\n",
    "5. Interpreted\n",
    "When a programming language is interpreted, it means that the source code is executed line by line, and not all at once. Programming languages such as C++ or Java are not interpreted, and hence need to be compiled first to run them. There is no need to compile Python because it is processed at runtime by the interpreter.\n",
    "6. Portable\n",
    "Python is portable in the sense that the same code can be used on different machines. There is no need to write a program multiple times for several platforms.\n",
    "7. Object-Oriented and Procedure-Oriented\n",
    "A programming language is object-oriented if it focuses design around data and objects, rather than functions and logic.\n",
    "8. Extensible\n",
    "9. Expressive\n",
    "10. Support for GUI\n",
    "11. Dynamically Typed\n",
    "12. High-level Language\n",
    "Python is a high-level programming language because programmers don’t need to remember the system architecture, nor do they have to manage the memory. This makes it super programmer-friendly and is one of the key features of Python.\n",
    "13. Dynamic Binding\n",
    "14. Strong Community Support\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Describe the role of predefined keywords in python and provide example of how they are used in program.\n",
    "\n",
    " Ans:- Python Keywords are some predefined and reserved words in Python that have special meanings. Keywords are used to define the syntax of the coding. The keyword cannot be used as an identifier, function, or variable name. All the keywords in Python are written in lowercase except True and False. There are 35 keywords in Python.\n",
    "* False      * None\n",
    "* True      * and\n",
    "* as      * assert\n",
    "* async      * await\n",
    "* break      * class\n",
    "* continue      * def\n",
    "* del      * elif\n",
    "* else      * except\n",
    "* finally      * for\n",
    "* from      * global\n",
    "* if      * import\n",
    "* in      * is\n",
    "* lambda      * nonlocal\n",
    "* not      * or\n",
    "* pass      * raise\n",
    "* return      * try\n",
    "* while      * with\n",
    "* yield\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Compare and contrast mutable and immutable objects in python with example.\n",
    "\n",
    " Ans:- The major difference between mutable and immutable objects in Python is that mutable objects can be modified or changed after their creation but the immutable objects can not be modified after their creation. This makes immutable objects final objects.\n",
    "   Mutable in Python:- \n",
    "      The list is mutable in Python since it is changeable. The values in the list can be modified after creating it. This is the difference between mutable and immutable. Values assigned to the list are not final and are changeable.\n",
    "   Immutable in Python:- \n",
    "       The tuple in Python is immutable. The tuple is immutable since it carries the final value in it and does not allow the changes. It carries a sting and list and since string is immutable hence it is immutable.\n",
    " \n",
    "4. Discuss the different types of operators in python and provide examples of how they are used.\n",
    "\n",
    " Ans:- In Python, operators are special symbols or keywords that carry out operations on values and python variables. They serve as a basis for expressions, which are used to modify data and execute computations. Python contains several operators, each with its unique purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "     Types of Python Operators:\n",
    "\n",
    "   Python language supports various types of operators, which are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Arithmetic Operators\n",
    "Comparison (Relational) Operators\n",
    "Assignment Operators\n",
    "Logical Operators\n",
    "Bitwise Operators\n",
    "Membership Operators\n",
    "Identity Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Explain the concept of type casting in python with examples.\n",
    "\n",
    " Ans:- Type casting is a method used to change the variables/ values declared in a certain data type into a different data type to match the operation required to be performed by the code snippet. In python, this feature can be accomplished by using constructor functions like int(), string(), float(), etc. The type casting process’s execution can be performed by using two different types of type casting, such as implicit type casting and explicit type casting.\n",
    " \n",
    "     Types of Casting in Python\n",
    "Python has two types of type conversion:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Implicit Type casting:\n",
    "   Implicit type conversion is performed automatically by the interpreter, without user intervention. Python automatically converts one data type to another data type. This process doesn’t need any user involvement Python promotes the conversion of lower data type, for example, integer to higher data type says float to avoid data loss. This type of conversion or type casting is called UpCasting.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Explicit Type casting:\n",
    "   In Explicit Type conversion, the user or programmer converts the data type of an object to the required data type. In Python we use predefined functions like int(), float(), str(), bool() etc to perform explicit type conversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "     Syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "(Required datatype) (Expression)\n",
    "           ↓\n",
    "(Desired type)\n",
    "      \n",
    "6. How to conditional statements work in python illustrate with examples.\n",
    "\n",
    " Ans:- Conditional statements are an essential part of programming in Python. They allow you to make decisions based on the values of variables or the result of comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "* How to use the if Statement in Python\n",
    "   The if statement allows you to execute a block of code if a certain condition is true. Here's the basic syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "if condition:\n",
    "    # code to execute if condition is true\n",
    "The condition can be any expression that evaluates to a Boolean value (True or False). If the condition is True, the code block indented below the if statement will be executed. If the condition is False, the code block will be skipped.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Here's an example of how to use an if statement to check if a number is positive:\n",
    "\n",
    "num = 5\n",
    "\n",
    "if num > 0:\n",
    "    print(\"The number is positive.\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "     Output:\n",
    "The number is positive.\n",
    "In this example, we use the > operator to compare the value of num to 0. If num is greater than 0, the code block indented below the if statement will be executed, and the message \"The number is positive.\" will be printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "* How to Use the else Statement in Python\n",
    "   The else statement allows you to execute a different block of code if the if condition is False. Here's the basic syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "if condition:\n",
    "    # code to execute if condition is true\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    # code to execute if condition is false\n",
    "If the condition is True, the code block indented below the if statement will be executed, and the code block indented below the else statement will be skipped.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the condition is False, the code block indented below the else statement will be executed, and the code block indented below the if statement will be skipped.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of how to use an if-else statement to check if a number is positive or negative:\n",
    "\n",
    "num = -5\n",
    "\n",
    "if num > 0:\n",
    "    print(\"The number is positive.\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"The number is negative.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "     Output:\n",
    "The number is negative.\n",
    "In this example, we use an if-else statement to check if num is greater than 0. If it is, the message \"The number is positive.\" is printed. If it is not (that is, num is negative or zero), the message \"The number is negative.\" is printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "* How to Use the elif Statement in Python\n",
    "   The elif statement allows you to check multiple conditions in sequence, and execute different code blocks depending on which condition is true. Here's the basic syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "if condition1:\n",
    "    # code to execute if condition1 is true\n",
    "elif condition2:\n",
    "    # code to execute if condition1 is false and condition2 is true\n",
    "elif condition3:\n",
    "    # code to execute if condition1 and condition2 are false, and condition3 is true\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    # code to execute if all conditions are false\n",
    "The elif statement is short for \"else if\", and can be used multiple times to check additional conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of how to use an if-elif-else statement to check if a number is positive, negative, or zero:\n",
    "\n",
    "num = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "if num > 0:\n",
    "    print(\"The number is positive.\")\n",
    "elif num < \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Describe the different types of loops in python and their use cases with examples.\n",
    "\n",
    " Ans:- A loop is an instruction that repeats multiple times as long as some condition is met.\n",
    " \n",
    "     Type of Loops:\n",
    "There are mainly two types of loops. Let’s discuss them one by one.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For Loop:\n",
    "   A for loop in Python is used to iterate over a sequence (list, tuple, set, dictionary, and string).\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Syntax: for iterating_var in sequence:  \n",
    "\n",
    "   statement(s) \n",
    "   \n",
    "2. While Loop:\n",
    "   The while loop is used to execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.\n",
    "   Syntax: while expression:  \n",
    "\n",
    "    statements  \n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Nested Loop:\n",
    "   If a loop exists inside the body of another loop, it is called a nested loop."
